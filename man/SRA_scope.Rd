\title{Stock-reduction analysis (SRA) for conditioning operating models}
\usage{
SRA_scope(OM, Chist, Index = NULL, CAA = NULL, CAL = NULL,
  ML = NULL, length_bin = NULL, I_type = NULL,
  selectivity = c("logistic", "dome"), C_eq = 0, cores = 1L,
  integrate = FALSE, figure = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{OM}{An object of class \linkS4class{OM} that specifies natural mortality (M), growth (Linf, K, t0, a, b), stock-recruitment relationship,
steepness, maturity parameters (L50 and L50_95), recruitment variability (Perr), as well as catch/index uncertainty (Cobs, Iobs).}

\item{Chist}{A vector of historical catch, should be of length OM@nyears. Ideally, the first year of the catch series represents
unfished conditions.}

\item{Index}{A matrix of historical indices of abundances, with rows indexing years and columns indexing fleets.}

\item{CAA}{Age compositions with nyears rows and OM@maxage columns.}

\item{CAL}{Length compositions with nyears rows and columns index the length bin.}

\item{ML}{A vector of mean length observations (length OM@nyears).}

\item{length_bin}{A vector for the midpoints of the length bins in \code{CAL}. All length bin widths should be equal in size.}

\item{I_type}{A character vector of length \code{nrow(Index)} to indicate the type of biomass for which the index follows. Either \code{"B"} for
total biomass, \code{"SSB"} for spawning biomass, or \code{"VB"} for vulnerable biomass. If \code{NULL}, "B" is used.}

\item{selectivity}{Whether to use logistic or dome selectivity in the stock-reduction analysis.}

\item{C_eq}{Equilibrium catch prior to the first year of the operating model. Zero implies unfished conditions in year one. Otherwise, this is used
would estimate depletion in year one.}

\item{cores}{Integer for the number of cores for the stock-reduction analysis.}

\item{integrate}{Logical, whether to treat recruitment deviations as penalized parameters (FALSE) or random effects (TRUE).}

\item{figure}{Logical, whether to plot diagnostic figures (histograms of estimated depletion and unfished recruitment, SRA outputs, model fits, etc.).}
}
\description{
Intended for conditioning operating models for data-limited stocks. From a historical time series of total catch, and potentially
age/length compositions and multiple indices of abundance, the SRA returns a range of values for depletion, selectivity,
unfished recruitment (R0), historical fishing effort, and recruitment deviations. This is done by sampling life history parameters
from an operating model provided by the user and fitting to the data in a statistical catch-at-age model. This function is intended
to generate potential depletion scenarios that could supported from sparse data.
}
\details{
One of indices, age compositions, or length compositions should be provided in addition to the historical catch.
Selectivity is fixed if no age or length compositions are provided.
}
\note{
If the operating model \code{OM} uses time-varying growth or M, then those trends will be used in the SRA as well.
